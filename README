How to build ATIRE
------------------
ATIRE builds with the native compilers on Mac (Xcode), Linux (gcc), and Windows (Visual Studio).  The build process is the same in all cases.

First, get the source code:

> hg clone http://www.atire.org/hg/atire

Second, build

>make

This should leave you with a numner of executable files in the bin directory. one of those tools, index, is the indexer.  Another, atire, is the search engine.

Please contact us if you need help building or running ATIRE.
