uasi stellar diameters and intensity fluctuations it is shown that there are relativistic limits on the fluctuations in brightness which may be observed for a large spherical source and also for more general sources so that quasi stellar objects are probably no more than light days in size there is thus a possibility that they may be close to our galaxy
