Any article that mentions health benefits of olive oil is fine, EXCEPT those in which the claim is based on either unpopular/obscure or unscientific methods.

  <narrative>Recently, the Public Broadcasting Service aired a series of documentaries entitled "We shall remain" about the history of the native americans resistance to colonial occupation of their land, now known as the USA.This documentary was quite fascinating in that it shed a new light on the american indians, the protagonists and how they struggled to resist the colonial settlers and american expansionism. I would like to find articles that document the several wars fought from before the american revolution (1783) till the end of world war I (1917). For an article or passage to be relevant, it must include passages about these american indian wars. Articles on specific wars such as the Pequot wars or the Wounded knee massacre are relevant. Passages or articles about the forcible removal of indians to Indians reservations would also be relevant (e.g. Cherokee trail of tears). Articles about treaties signed between the native americans and the federal government are also relevant.  However articles about american indians in general documenting their tribes, beliefs or ways of life are not relevant if they do not include any passage about wars fought against the colonial settlers. Of no relevance also are articles about native american folkore or foods nor will be articles about wars involving the country India in Asia.</narrative>

  <description>Find information about GLSL-OpenGL Shading Language.</description>
  <narrative>GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), also known as GLslang, is a high level shading language based on the C programming language. It was created to give the developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use assembly language or hardware-specific languages.    I would like to know more about this topic as it is the base for the Particle Emission project I am working on. Historically, GLSL was preceded by various OpenGL extensions such as ARB_vertex_program and ARB_fragment_program and GLSL unifies vertex and fragment processing in a single instruction set. Hence I found this GLSL OpenGL shading language as a specialized term and when I used it as a query, in the top 100 elements I found 48 of them were relevant.       From my point of view I would like to get the collection of articles with description about GLSL or the History of GLSL and the details of the functions and coding methodologies used in it and any constructive information about the shading language.  If I find these elements then it would be relevant from my point of view.  </narrative>

  <description>Find information on mutual exclusion used for operating systems</description>
  <narrative>There are several mutual exclusion techniques for operating systems.  However, detailed mechanisms of mutual exclusion are often written in  textbooks. In addition, not all techniques are picked up in textbooks,  such as recently developed ones.    For my OS course in my university, I would like to survey the mutual  exclusion techniques including recent ones which are not appeared in  textbooks for the lecture.  For this reason, explicit differences  among them and detailed explanation are important.  Some textbooks do  not explicitly explain, for example, the relationship between lock and  semaphore, while the lecturer must teach the difference.    First, I narrow the articles on operating systems, then again narrow  the sections with a paragraph on mutual exclusion.    The relevant elements should include detailed descriptions on mutual  exclusion techniques, such as how it works, why it is ensured, and  what is different from other ones.  Therefore, a list of techniques,  its history, and a list of references are regarded as irrelevant ones.  </narrative>

I expect to find some scientific facts on the topic, and I also would like to have an idea about the opinion of the scientists leaders, the main organizations (politics, ecologists, NGO, etc).
